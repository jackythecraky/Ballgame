Time Series Forecasting


Load the Forecast Package into RStudio
install.packages('forecast')
library(forecast)
    • Load the Air Passengers’ Dataset and View Its Class
data("AirPassengers")
class(AirPassengers)
Here, ts represents that it’s a time series dataset.
    • Display the Dataset

Let’s check on our date values
start(AirPassengers)
[1] 1949	1
end(AirPassengers)
[1] 1960 	12
So, our start date is January 1949, while the end date is December 1960.
    • Find out If There Are Any Missing Values
sum(is.na(AirPassengers))
[1] 0
    • Check the Summary of the Dataset
summary(AirPassengers)

    • Plot the Dataset
plot(AirPassengers)
    • Decompose the Data Into Four Components
tsdata <- ts(AirPassengers, frequency = 12)
ddata <- decompose(tsdata, "multiplicative")
plot(ddata)

    • Plot the Different Components Individually
plot(ddata$trend)
plot(ddata$seasonal)
plot(ddata$random)


    • Plot a Trendline on the Original Dataset
plot(AirPassengers)
abline(reg=lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers)))
    • Create a Box Plot by Cycle
boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers, xlab="Date", ylab = "Passenger Numbers (1000's)", main = "Monthly air passengers boxplot from 1949-1960"))

From the above plot, you can see that the number of ticket sales goes higher in June, July, and August as compared to the other months of the years.
