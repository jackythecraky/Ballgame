 Data Visualization with ggplot2    (pract 1)

install.packages("tidyverse")
	library(tidyverse)


1. Creating a ggplot
ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = country))


2. How many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?
nrow(internet)
ncol(internet)


3. Aesthetic Mappings:
	1. Color by usage:

ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = country, color = usage))


2. size by usage:
	code:
		ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = country, size = usage))


3.Alpha by usage:
	code:
		ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = country, alpha = usage))


4. Color:
	code:
		ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = country), color = "orange")


5. Shapes:
	
	code:
		ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = country), shape = 22, color="purple")



6. Facets:
	1. facet_wrap:
	code:
		ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = rate)) + 				
facet_wrap(~ country, nrow = 2)


7z. Geometric Objects
code:
	ggplot(data = internet) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = income))



code:
	ggplot(data = internet) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = income)) + 	geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = usage, y = income))


code:
	ggplot(data = internet, mapping = aes(x = usage, y = income)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = country)) + geom_smooth()
